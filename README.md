# EpikGroup

## Group Members
Pooja Ginjupalli -> Hello!
Alvin Shao -> HI!
Christy Xia -> Hello, world!

## Our Tech Stack
UI/UX -> Figma
Front-End -> Next.js (Christy), HTML/CSS 
Back-End -> Java (Alvin), Springboot
Databases -> SQL Server or Firebase
Machine Learning -> Python (Pooja), Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn

## Our Project Ideas
1. **Clothing Recommender** -> Takes items in your closet and recommends matching items
    - Take a cosplay and find items of clothing that would make a more casual and accessible version of it
        - sort by price and other categories
        - (optional) find specific fabric and material for making the clothing out of, if the outfit is made by hand
    - generating outfit based on certain aesthetics (e.g. dark academia, streetwear, techno, formal, coquette, etc.), time period, pricing, etc.
        - piece specific styling; give the program a specific piece and have it style it with different clothing combinations
        - having a sidebar to edit the color and other aspects of the generated outfit
    -(**Look into later**) How will the program take the clothing from your wardrobe as it needs images and sometimes the piece of clothing is unique and can't be found online or has been altered.

2. Stony Brook Arts/Crafts Marketplace -> Kind of like Facebook Marketplace for SBU students
3. 3D Landscape Generator -> Very ambitious! :'D (Reach)
    - high fantasy
    - !! Quest Plotline generator (with images?!?!?!? and dialogue?!?!?!) (inspo from sao...)
        - generated based on a particular genre?
