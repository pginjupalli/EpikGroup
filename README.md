## Our Project Ideas
1. Clothing Recommender -> Takes items in your closet and recommends matching items
    - Take a cosplay and find items of clothing that would make a more casual and accessible version of it
        - sort by price and other categories
        - (optional) find specific fabric and material for making the clothing out of, if the outfit is made by hand
    - generating outfit based on certain aesthetics (e.g. dark academia, streetwear, techno, formal, coquette, etc.), time period, pricing, etc.
        - piece specific styling; give the program a specific piece and have it style it with different clothing combinations
        - having a sidebar to edit the color and other aspects of the generated outfit
    -(**Look into later**) How will the program take the clothing from your wardrobe as it needs images and sometimes the piece of clothing is unique and can't be found online or has been altered.
